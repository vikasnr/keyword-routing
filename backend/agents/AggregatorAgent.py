            Aggregate the response and make it look good using markdown. 
            Please format the response using **Markdown**. Follow these guidelines:  
                - Use **bold** and *italic* for emphasis.  
                - Use bullet points (â€¢) or numbered lists when necessary.  
                - Format code snippets inside triple backticks (` ``` `).  
                - Add appropriate **headings** (e.g., `## Summary`, `### Key Points`).  
                - Use emojis where relevant to enhance readability. 
             Only include the aggregated responses in the response. Do not include any other text in the response.\n\n
