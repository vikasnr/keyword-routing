      "Regional variations of the relative signifi cance of the various components of the \n",

      "one part of the system will be experienced in other parts of the system. Lakes are linked \n",
      "to rivers through the hydrological cycle. Lakes have many origins; major lakes are \n",
      "usually formed by glacial erosion or through tectonic activity. Lakes are dynamic, and \n",
      "evolve through time; young lakes tend to be deep, with limited biological activity, while \n",
      "older lakes tend to be shallow with high levels of biodiversity. Since the middle of the \n",
      "twentieth century, dam building has accelerated to the point where over 60% of the \n",
      "world's rivers are now regulated. The impacts of this regulation are widespread, and \n",
      "include detrimental hydrological, ecological, geomorphological, and socio-economic \n",
      "effects. It is concluded that humans need to develop a reverence for rivers and lakes, \n",
      "and to recognize the interdependence of all creatures and resources. \n",
      " \n",
      "1. Introduction \n",
      " \n",
      "A river refers to any natural stream of water that flows in a channel with defined banks. \n",
      "The word river comes from the Latin ripa, which means \"bank.\" Central to the \n",
      "definition is the concept of channeled surface flow. The word \"stream\" is commonly \n",
      "used interchangeably with river. Stream is derived from the Indo-European route srou. \n",
      "Smaller, natural watercourses have various names including rivulets, brooks, burns, \n",
      "creeks, and so on. Rivers should not be confused with flows confined in human-made \n",
      "engineering structures such as canals, pipes, or culverts. Rivers make up only a tiny \n",
      "percentage of the world's water. Ninety seven percent of the world's water is held in the \n",
      "oceans, of the remaining three percent which is fresh water, three quarters is stored as \n",
      "land ice (i.e., in glaciers, ice caps), lakes contain half a percent, soil moisture 0.05%, \n",
      "and river channels only 0.025 %. Rivers thus represent only one four-thousandth of the \n",
      "planet's total water. Although rivers make up a small percentage of the landscape, their \n",
      "impact on the landscape extends far beyond the channel itself.  \n",
      " \n",
      "From a geomorphologic perspective, rivers have three main functions; to erode, \n",
      "transport, and deposit sediment. In the process of accomplishing these three tasks, rivers \n",
      "destroy old landforms and create new ones. From a hydrological perspective, rivers are \n",
      "an important component of the hydrological cycle. Rivers are also significant in a \n",
      "biological sense, where water bodies can be divided into running (lotic) and standing \n",
      "(lentic) systems. Lotic systems consist of rivers and estuaries, while lentic systems \n",
      "consist of lakes, ponds, coastal lakes, estuaries, and wetlands. This chapter will consist \n",
      "of three major sections, rivers, lakes, and dams. Rivers and lakes are ultimately the \n",
      "major manifestations of the way in which subsurface and surface water move through a \n",
      "landscape. It is impossible to begin to understand how rivers and lakes are formed or \n",
      "how they function without considering the hydrological cycle.  \n",
      " \n",
      "2. The Hydrological Cycle \n",
      " \n",
      "The abundance of water on the earth, and its occurrence in different forms (solid, liquid, \n",
      "and gaseous), is unique in the solar system. It is the ability of water to change from one \n",
      "phase to another that allows life as we know it on Earth to exist. Water in the form of \n",
      "rain and other precipitation (snow, hail, and sleet) falls on the continents and oceans. \n",
      "The water can then be evaporated directly back to the atmosphere. Water that is not \n",

      "directly into the soil, where it will be stored as soil moisture or ground water. Over time, \n",
      "under the influence of gravity, the soil water will eventually make its way to the river as \n",
      "subsurface runoff. Water may also move back up to the soil surface through capillary \n",
      "action and then be evaporated back to the atmosphere. In addition, water may be utilized \n",
      "by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere through the process of transpiration. \n",
      "Water that runs off over the slope directly into the channel is known as surface runoff. It \n",
      "is important to note that runoff refers to all water that leaves the slope, drainage basin, \n",
      "soils, and river channel. The final path that precipitation may take is to fall directly into \n",
      "a river or lake, this is known as direct runoff. Precipitation in the form of snow or ice \n",
      "may also be stored in hollows or other places of accumulation. This movement of water \n",
      "from the atmosphere to the earth's surface and thence on to the oceans is known as the \n",
      "hydrological cycle, and is important in understanding how rivers and lakes operate \n",
      "(Figure 1).  \n",

      "Figure 1. The hydrological cycle \n",
      " \n",
      "The annual evaporation from the oceans is equivalent to a 1.4 m thick layer of water \n",
      "over the surface of the earth. Ninety percent of this is returned directly to the oceans via \n",
      "precipitation, the remainder falls on the continents. Of the remaining 10%, 35% is \n",

      "variables such as lithology, tectonic history, and long-term climatic change are \n",

      "a ratio to its change in longitudinal dist ance. In many rivers, steeper gradients are \n",
      "usually associated with the upper, mountainous source area of the river. The gradient \n",
      "decreases with distance from the source so that near the  river's exit to the ocean the \n",
      "gradient is normally very flat, and consequently the river is often wide and shallow. The \n",
      "gradient of a river can be seen through plotting a long profile of a channel. The long \n",
      "profile of a river can help point to the te ctonic history of the river, and often the \n",

Although rivers make up a small percentage of the landscape, their \\nimpact on the landscape extends far beyond the channel itself.  \\n \\nFrom a geomorphologic perspective, rivers have three main functions; to erode, \\ntransport, and deposit sediment. In the process of accomplishing these three tasks, rivers \\ndestroy old landforms and create new ones. From a hydrological perspective, rivers are \\nan important component of the hydrological cycle. Rivers are also significant in a \\nbiological sense, where water bodies can be divided into running (lotic) and standing \\n(lentic) systems. Lotic systems consist of rivers and estuaries, while lentic systems \\nconsist of lakes, ponds, coastal lakes, estuaries, and wetlands. This chapter will consist \\nof three major sections, rivers, lakes, and dams. Rivers and lakes are ultimately the \\nmajor manifestations of the way in which subsurface and surface water move through a \\nlandscape. It is impossible to begin to understand how rivers and lakes are formed or \\nhow they function without considering the hydrological cycle.  \\n \\n2. The Hydrological Cycle \\n \\nThe abundance of water on the earth, and its occurrence in different forms (solid, liquid, \\nand gaseous), is unique in the solar system. It is the ability of water to change from one \\nphase to another that allows life as we know it on Earth to exist. Water in the form of \\nrain and other precipitation (snow, hail, and sleet) falls on the continents and oceans. \\nThe water can then be evaporated directly back to the atmosphere. Water that is not \\nevaporated directly back into the atmosphere has a number of pathways. It may infiltrate\",\n",

At this time scale, factors such as lithology and tectonic history are constants (or independent variables), and as such, will have little impact on the river system. What is clear is th at rivers are dynamic, res ponding to a variety of energy \\ninputs. Depending on the nature of the system, these changes in energy inputs may be \\nabsorbed by the system without any significa nt change to form or process—this is \\ncalled negative feedback. Alternately, a river may alter its form or process in response \\nto a change in energy (positive feedback). What  is clear, however, is that fluvial systems \\nare constantly evolving.  \\n6.

The ba sis of understanding \\nrivers and lakes is the hydrological cycl e. The hydrological cycle refers to the \\nmovement of water from the atmosphere to Earth's surface and thence to the oceans. \\nRegional variations of the relative signifi cance of the various components of the \\nhydrological cycle determine the amount of wa ter available for rive rs and lakes. The \\nland surface area that contributes water to a river is known as the drainage basin. \\nDrainage basin lithology and stru ctural fabric determine the type of drainage pattern that \\na river displays. The ability of a river to tr ansport material also has an impact on river \\nchannel pattern.

       "'The process for the settlement of maturity claims in life insurance involves several steps:\\n\\n1. **Policy Maturity**: The policyholder must live through the duration of the policy to become eligible for the maturity value.\\n\\n2. **Notification**: The insurer sends a claim discharge voucher to the policyholder well before the date of maturity. This voucher needs to be signed and witnessed.\\n\\n3. **Required Documents**: To receive the maturity value, the policyholder must submit:\\n   - Age proof, if age was not admitted at the time of proposal.\\n   - The original policy document, which will be canceled upon payment.\\n\\n4. **Verification**: If age was not admitted during the proposal stage, age proof must be submitted before the payment of the maturity value.\\n\\n5. **Payment**: Once all the necessary documents are submitted and verified, the insurer processes the payment of the maturity claim.\\n\\n6. **No Nomination Role**: Since the policyholder is alive, the nomination (if any) does not play a role in the settlement of the maturity claim.\\n\\nThis process ensures that the rightful policyholder receives the maturity benefits as per the terms of their insurance policy.'"
