      "one part of the system will be experienced in other parts of the system. Lakes are linked \n",
      "to rivers through the hydrological cycle. Lakes have many origins; major lakes are \n",
      "usually formed by glacial erosion or through tectonic activity. Lakes are dynamic, and \n",
      "evolve through time; young lakes tend to be deep, with limited biological activity, while \n",
      "older lakes tend to be shallow with high levels of biodiversity. Since the middle of the \n",
      "twentieth century, dam building has accelerated to the point where over 60% of the \n",
      "world's rivers are now regulated. The impacts of this regulation are widespread, and \n",
      "include detrimental hydrological, ecological, geomorphological, and socio-economic \n",

      " \n",
      "1. Introduction \n",
      " \n",
      "A river refers to any natural stream of water that flows in a channel with defined banks. \n",
      "The word river comes from the Latin ripa, which means \"bank.\" Central to the \n",
      "definition is the concept of channeled surface flow. The word \"stream\" is commonly \n",
      "used interchangeably with river. Stream is derived from the Indo-European route srou. \n",
      "Smaller, natural watercourses have various names including rivulets, brooks, burns, \n",
      "creeks, and so on. Rivers should not be confused with flows confined in human-made \n",
      "engineering structures such as canals, pipes, or culverts. Rivers make up only a tiny \n",
      "percentage of the world's water. Ninety seven percent of the world's water is held in the \n",
      "oceans, of the remaining three percent which is fresh water, three quarters is stored as \n",
      "land ice (i.e., in glaciers, ice caps), lakes contain half a percent, soil moisture 0.05%, \n",
      "and river channels only 0.025 %. Rivers thus represent only one four-thousandth of the \n",
      "planet's total water. Although rivers make up a small percentage of the landscape, their \n",
      "impact on the landscape extends far beyond the channel itself.  \n",
      " \n",
      "From a geomorphologic perspective, rivers have three main functions; to erode, \n",
      "transport, and deposit sediment. In the process of accomplishing these three tasks, rivers \n",
      "destroy old landforms and create new ones. From a hydrological perspective, rivers are \n",
      "an important component of the hydrological cycle. Rivers are also significant in a \n",
      "biological sense, where water bodies can be divided into running (lotic) and standing \n",
      "(lentic) systems. Lotic systems consist of rivers and estuaries, while lentic systems \n",
      "consist of lakes, ponds, coastal lakes, estuaries, and wetlands. This chapter will consist \n",
      "of three major sections, rivers, lakes, and dams. Rivers and lakes are ultimately the \n",
      "major manifestations of the way in which subsurface and surface water move through a \n",

      "how they function without considering the hydrological cycle.  \n",

      " \n",
      "The abundance of water on the earth, and its occurrence in different forms (solid, liquid, \n",
      "and gaseous), is unique in the solar system. It is the ability of water to change from one \n",
      "phase to another that allows life as we know it on Earth to exist. Water in the form of \n",
      "rain and other precipitation (snow, hail, and sleet) falls on the continents and oceans. \n",

      "under the influence of gravity, the soil water will eventually make its way to the river as \n",
      "subsurface runoff. Water may also move back up to the soil surface through capillary \n",
      "action and then be evaporated back to the atmosphere. In addition, water may be utilized \n",
      "by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere through the process of transpiration. \n",
      "Water that runs off over the slope directly into the channel is known as surface runoff. It \n",
      "is important to note that runoff refers to all water that leaves the slope, drainage basin, \n",
      "soils, and river channel. The final path that precipitation may take is to fall directly into \n",
      "a river or lake, this is known as direct runoff. Precipitation in the form of snow or ice \n",
      "may also be stored in hollows or other places of accumulation. This movement of water \n",
      "from the atmosphere to the earth's surface and thence on to the oceans is known as the \n",

      "The drainage basin (or catchment area) is the most convenient unit for the study of \n",
      "rivers. The drainage basin refers to the land surface area that contributes water (and \n",
      "sediment) to the river channel. The study of drainage basin morphology (surface form) \n",
      "is termed morphometric analysis. The American engineer, Robert E. Horton described \n",
      "in mathematical terms the relationshi p between drainage basin morphometry, \n",
      "hydrology, and landscape evolution. The basis of morphometric analysis is the ordering \n",
      "of the stream network. The most common means of doing this is through a method \n",
      "developed by Strahler. This method involves designating the \"finger tip\" tributaries, first \n",
      "order streams; where two first order streams join they form a second order stream, when \n",
      "two second order streams join, they form a third order stream and so on (Figure 2). The \n",
      "ordering of the stream network makes it possible to define the relationship between \n",
      "stream order, stream number, stream length, drainage basin area, and stream  gradient. \n",
      "All these relationships have a significant impact on the type of river that exists. They \n",

      "rocks (Figure 3a). Where the drainage basin is strongly influenced by zones of weakness \n",
      "such as faults and joints, the river follows these lines of weakness and they develop a \n",
      "parallel pattern (Figure 3b). In drainage basins that are strongly affected by the folding \n",

      "variables such as lithology, tectonic history, and long-term climatic change are \n",

      "As rivers flow downstream, so potential energy is converted into motion (kinetic \n",

      "a ratio to its change in longitudinal dist ance. In many rivers, steeper gradients are \n",
      "usually associated with the upper, mountainous source area of the river. The gradient \n",
      "decreases with distance from the source so that near the  river's exit to the ocean the \n",
      "gradient is normally very flat, and consequently the river is often wide and shallow. The \n",
      "gradient of a river can be seen through plotting a long profile of a channel. The long \n",
      "profile of a river can help point to the te ctonic history of the river, and often the \n",
